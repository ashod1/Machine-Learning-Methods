# Machine-Learning-Methods
I program and explain different machine learning algorithms that I find interesting. The explanations are in the pdf file, and the actual algorithms are written in Python. Some are implemented on astrophysics in my other repositories. Here are the topics covered (so far):

- Local Linear Regression
- k-d tree
- Decision trees
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
